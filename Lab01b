_Growth mindset is the ability to recognize that no matter how much you know or thing you know you can and should be learning more.  It won't be easy but focusing on your why and endstate shoudld be the reason to keep you motivated when you're struggling with a difficult project._ 
In order to remind myself to keep a growth mindset I should always:
1. Remember my why.
2. Know that what I'm doing is difficult, I will fail and so have many others. I will remember to pick myself up, dust myself off, ask good questions, and move forward.
3. There's always something more to learn.  I should always be in a state of discomfort learning something new and unfamiliar. Be comfortable with the uncomfortable.
