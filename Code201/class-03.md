  - script: a seriers of instructions taht a computer can follow one-by-one, each step is known as a statement, statement end with a semicolon
  - use camelCase for naming variables
  - each statement should start on its own line, makes it easier to read
  - code block: statements surrounded by curly braces ({}), 
  - use // for one line comments, use /* for multiline comments and end it with */
  - variables: used to store temporary bits of information
  - variables need to be assigned a value
    - Ex: `let quantity = 3;` let = keyword, quantity = variable name, = = assignment operator, 3 = variable value
  - numeric data type: 3
  - string data type: 'Hello'
  - boolean data type: true
  - use \ before any type of quote mark that appreas within a string to escape the quotation characters
  - variables can store numeric data, string data, or boolean data
  - once a variable has been assigned it can be changed again without assigning it another variable name just the value
  - 6 rules for naming variables:
    1) name must begin with a letter, $, or underscore cannot begin with number
    2) name can contain letters, $, or underscore but cannot contain dash or period
    3) cannot use keywords or reserved words
    4) all variables are case sensitive, so score and Score are different variable names, this is bad practice however
    5) use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
    6) use camelCase for multiple words in a variable name or underscore
  - arrays: special type of variable, stores list of values that are related to one another, values inside don't need to be the same data type can be strings with numbers and/or booleans. can also be used with () instead of [] but [] are preferred.
    - ex: `let food = ['bread', 'cheese', 'meat'];`
  - index: start at 0, assiged to each item in an array, can be called (ex: using the previous example above, `let itemThree = food[2];`, I would be calling the 'meat' string)
  - expressions: resluts in a single value can be either strictly assigned from a variable or two or more values to return a single value 
    - ex: `let area = 3 * 3` 
  - operators: relied on by expressions, can create a single value from one or more values
    - Ex: assignment operators, arithmetic operators (pg76), string operators (pg78), comparison operators (>), logical operators (&&)
