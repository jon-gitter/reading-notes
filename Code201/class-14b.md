  - people are different, need to understand their strengths and weaknesses
  - teams that argue/fight might not be completly negative.  memebers might have passion for what they're doing or what they're working on. silence and order might not always be the best environment
  - when each individually was able/did communicate evenly in the group, the team performed better and had a higher intelligence
  - personally i liked team B, even though it seemed more chaotic it looked like they trusted one another and could have comfortable conversations even if they disagreed
  - as leaders problems and issues are never fully clear.  You need a way to survey your team members annoymously so you can make good changes to increase performance and great group dynamics
