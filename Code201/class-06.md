- _Chapter 3: Object Literals (pp.100-105)_
  - objects: group together a set of variables and functions to createa  model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
  - Property: variables that are part of objects, they tell us about the object
  - methods: when a function is part of an object
  - key: cannot have two in the same object with same name, it is the name and and value in an object
  - creating and object:
    - ``` 
    var hotel = {
      name: 'Quay',
      rooms: 40,
      booked: 25,
      checkAvailability: function(){
        return this.room - this.booked:
      }
    }
    ```
  - accessing an object and dot notation:
    ```
    var hotelName = hotel.name;
    var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();
    ```
