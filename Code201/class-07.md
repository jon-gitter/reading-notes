  ### Duckett JS Book
- _Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, Objects (pp.106-144)_
  - object constructors use a function as a template for creating objects
    - first create the template with the object's properties and methods
  - can use constructor funcitons to to create new objects you make based on an earlier function
  - create the object, then add properties and methods
  - _this_ is commonly used inside functions and objects. where the function is declared alters what _this_ means. it always referes to one object, usually the object in which the function operates
  - in JS data is represented using name/value pairs, organize data using an array or object to group a set of related values. in arrrays and objects the name is also known as a key
  - if you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object (each key name must be unique), if the order of the items is important use an array
  - six data types
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - undefined
    - null
  - complex data type:
    - object
  - when you have a vale that is a number you can use the methods and properties of the number object on it
  - use math objects Math.round(), Math.ceil() (page 134) for mathematical constants and functions
  - random number example on pg 135
