- _Learn CSS - Layout: https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/_
  - display property: determines if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block
    - display: makes the box a block-level box, and also converts its children to flex items. This enables the flex properties that control alignment, ordering and flow
  - flexbox: a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
  - grid: designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space). enables you to write layout rules on an element that has display: grid, and introduces a few new primitives for layout styling, such as the repeat() and minmax() functions.
  - floats: uses text to wrap around an image
  - multicolumn layout: use column-count and column-gap for a specific ul you're targeting
  - position property: changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements.
