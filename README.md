## Hi! My name is Jon and I'm a student learning how to code.  I'm excited to start my journey in IT and bring more technical expertise to my leadership experience from the military and business world.

_Growth mindset is the ability to recognize that no matter how much you know or thing you know you can and should be learning more.  It won't be easy but focusing on your why and endstate shoudld be the reason to keep you motivated when you're struggling with a difficult project._ 
In order to remind myself to keep a growth mindset I should always:
1. Remember my why.
2. Know that what I'm doing is difficult, I will fail and so have many others. I will remember to pick myself up, dust myself off, ask good questions, and move forward.
3. There's always something more to learn.  I should always be in a state of discomfort learning something new and unfamiliar. Be comfortable with the uncomfortable.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

**Different Classifications of Text Editors**
- Text Editors
- IDEs

_Why do Software Developers need to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code?_
- It's important to not limit yourself with powerful tools that can help expedite your coding or make coding easier with additional features that may or may not exist on different text editiors.  If you go with too basic of an editor you might be missing out on ways to easily collaborate with teammates and not properly identify errors that is supported on an IDE.  The difference would be using a nailgun (IDEs) versus a hammer and nails (text editor). 

## Terminal Cheat Sheet

- pwd = print working directory, tells you what your current working directory is
- -ls = list, shows what is currently in the directory we're in
- -l = long listing, can be added after -ls. first character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d ) Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory. The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this). The next field is the owner of the file or directory. The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case). Following this is the file size. Next up is the file modification time. Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.
- ls /etc = We ran ls with a command line argument ( /etc ). When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.
- ls -l /etc = We ran ls with both a command line option and argument. As such it did a long listing of the directory /etc.
- two types of paths **absolute** and **relative**
- absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. easily ID'd b/c they begin with /
- relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system, they do not begin with /
- ~ = This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- . = This is a reference to your current directory. It could also be written as ./Documents
- .. = This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
- cd = change directory, can be specified to an absoute or relative path
- use Tab to auto complete actions
- file = used to know for certain what type of file a particular file is
- 'text' = use quotes for single items
- \ = escape character, escapes the special meaning of the next character
- ls -a = shows all hidden files and directories
