## Terminal Cheat Sheet

- pwd = print working directory, tells you what your current working directory is
- -ls = list, shows what is currently in the directory we're in
- -l = long listing, can be added after -ls. first character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d ) Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory. The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this). The next field is the owner of the file or directory. The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case). Following this is the file size. Next up is the file modification time. Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.
- ls /etc = We ran ls with a command line argument ( /etc ). When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.
- ls -l /etc = We ran ls with both a command line option and argument. As such it did a long listing of the directory /etc.
- two types of paths **absolute** and **relative**
- absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. easily ID'd b/c they begin with /
- relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system, they do not begin with /
- ~ = This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- . = This is a reference to your current directory. It could also be written as ./Documents
- .. = This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
- cd = change directory, can be specified to an absoute or relative path
- use Tab to auto complete actions
- file = used to know for certain what type of file a particular file is
- 'text' = use quotes for single items
- \ = escape character, escapes the special meaning of the next character
- ls -a = shows all hidden files and directories
